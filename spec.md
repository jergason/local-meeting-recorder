# Local Meeting Note Taker

## Purpose

Record meeting notes for remote meetings that I participate in.

## Requirements

- No meeting joining, software runs locally on my machine.
- Notes are summarized with key points highlighted, action items, todos, etc.
- Also allows capturing the full transcript.
- Speaker diarization (i.e., identifying who said what).
- trascript can be edited before finalizing notes in case diarization or transcription is incorrect.
- notes can be re-created after editing

Help me research how to build this project. I'm open to different tech stacks, but would prefernot to use python.
